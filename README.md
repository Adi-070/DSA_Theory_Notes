<b>Algorithm</b>: An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input and produces a desired output. For example,An algorithm to add two numbers: Take two number inputs, Add numbers using the + operator, Display the result. Informally, an algorithm is nothing but a mention of steps to solve a problem.  Data structures are used to hold data while algorithms are used to solve the problem using that data.</br>

<b>Data Structures</b>: Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. Types of Data Structure: Linear data structure and Non-linear data structure</br>

<b>Linear data structures</b>: In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement. However, when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities. Popular linear data structures are: </br>
1. Array Data Structure: In an array, elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory. All the elements of an array are of the same type. </br>
2. Stack Data Structure: In stack data structure, elements are stored in the LIFO principle. That is, the last element stored in a stack will be removed first. It works just like a pile of plates where the last plate kept on the pile will be removed first. In a stack, operations can be perform only from one end (top here).</br>
3. Queue Data Structure: Unlike stack, the queue data structure works in the FIFO principle where first element stored in the queue will be removed first. It works just like a queue of people in the ticket counter where first person on the queue will get the ticket first. In a queue, addition and removal are performed from separate ends.</br>
4. Linked List Data Structure: In linked list data structure, data elements are connected through a series of nodes. And, each node contains the data items and address to the next node. </br>

<b>Non linear data structures </b>: Unlike linear data structures, elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence. Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements. Non-linear data structures are further divided into graph and tree based data structures. </br>
1. Graph Data Structure: In graph data structure, each node is called vertex and each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges. </br>
2. Trees Data Structure: Similar to a graph, a tree is also a collection of vertices and edges. However, in tree data structure, there can only be one edge between two vertices. </br>

<b>Asymptotic Analysis</b>: The efficiency is measured with the help of asymptotic notations. The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other resources required to execute the algorithm. Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm. There are mainly three asymptotic notations: Big-O notation, Omega notation, Theta notation. </b>
<b>Big-O Notation (O-notation)</b>: Big-O notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it gives the worst-case complexity of an algorithm. </b>
<b>Omega Notation (Ω-notation)</b>: Omega notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides the best case complexity of an algorithm. </b>
<b>Theta Notation (Θ-notation)</b>: Theta notation encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm. </br>

<b>The master theorem</> is used in calculating the time complexity of recurrence relations (divide and conquer algorithms) in a simple and quick way.
